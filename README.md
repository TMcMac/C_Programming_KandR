# The C Programming Language 2nd Ed
### By Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie

So this is a project to go through the central text of the C programming language. This was the first coding book I ever opened up for school and at the time it was way over my head. To be fair my only experience at that point was editing the html of my myspace page to add things like sweet flame effects. Now years later I want to take the time to go through this tome again and try to distill the vital information into videos that I'll share with the wider world and try to help the next group of new folks learn the joys of C.

While I wont do every single exercise or example I will do my best to hit all the really crucial ones as I share the most important details on YouTube. If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or suggestion please always feel free to DM me on socials. 

All the best and Happy Coding!

## Requirements
* A code editor - While you can do this work in any code editor there are two schools of thought on which way to go. If you go old school and work just in the terminal with something like Emacs of Vim, you'll need to really be on your toes as nothing will let you know something is wrong until you try to compile or your program doesn't work. The upside of this is that you will be a better programmer from this, and one that keeps an eye out for errors and issues yourself. The other path is to use a modern IDE like VScode, Atom, Sublime, etc. This will give you a hand up in formating and error checking much the way a spell checker does in google docs but it is also a bit of a crutch, though one you will work with in real life at a real job. The choice is yours of course and go with what you want to.

* A compiler - On Mac you can use Clang or GCC, on Linux it'll probably be GCC, Windows it may be MinGW. Whatever system you are using you can find a million articles on getting started with C and C++ online and they will give you the details and upsides of various copilers. Personally I started in Linux and even though I am in MacOS now I still use GCC out of habit.

* Some Patience - C can be tricky or seem archiac, it is from 1978 after all, but it is a really useful language to learn and one that will get you much closer to the metal than something like Python. It's a great way to learn/practice datastructures and algorithms as you don't have a lot of the built ins that higher level langauges have.

* (Optional) A copy of the book - Its great to have this book as it is evergreen when it comes to C, it really is the C bible. Even having it on your shelf at home or in the office feels like some computer street cred. I'll try to provide enough detail that you won't need it but if you can afford a copy (and there are plenty used ones on the secondary market) I recommend it.
